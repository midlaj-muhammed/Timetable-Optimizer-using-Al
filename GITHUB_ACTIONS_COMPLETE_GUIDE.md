The build will start automatically after upload, or you can:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **"🚀 Build Timetable Optimizer AI"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Select **"both"** for build type
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### ✅ Step 4: Monitor Build Progress
- 🟡 **Yellow circle**: Build in progress (8-15 minutes)
- ✅ **Green checkmark**: Build successful
- ❌ **Red X**: Build failed (check logs)

### ✅ Step 5: Download APK
1. Click on the completed workflow run
2. Scroll to **"Artifacts"** section
3. Download:
   - **🐛 TimetableOptimizer-Debug-APK** (for testing)
   - **🚀 TimetableOptimizer-Release-APK** (optimized)

## 🔧 Detailed Setup Process

### Method 1: Automated Upload (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd "/home/midlaj/Documents/Time Table Optimizer Using AI"

# Run the automated upload script
./upload_to_github.sh

# Follow the prompts to enter your GitHub credentials
```

### Method 2: Manual Upload
If the automated script doesn't work:

1. **Clone your repository:**

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: Build Fails with "gradlew: Permission denied"
**Solution**: The workflow automatically fixes this, but if it persists:
```yaml
- name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
  run: chmod +x gradlew
```

### Issue 2: "Android SDK not found"
**Solution**: The workflow sets up Android SDK automatically. Check if the `android-actions/setup-android@v3` step completed successfully.

### Issue 3: "Build failed with exit code 1"
**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. Click on the failed workflow run
2. Expand the failed step
3. Look for error messages

**Common Solutions**:
- Missing files: Ensure all project files are uploaded
- Dependency issues: Check `app/build.gradle` for correct versions
- Memory issues: The workflow is configured with appropriate memory limits

### Issue 4: "No artifacts found"
**Causes**:
- Build failed before APK generation
- APK path is incorrect

**Solution**:
Check the "📋 List Generated APKs" step to see what files were created.

### Issue 5: APK Won't Install on Device
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Android Version**: Requires Android 7.0+ (API 24)
2. **Enable Unknown Sources**: Must be enabled for APK installation
3. **Storage Space**: Ensure device has enough free space
4. **Try Debug APK**: If release APK fails, try debug version

## 🔄 Build Triggers

### Automatic Triggers:
- ✅ Push to `main` or `master` branch
- ✅ Pull request to `main` or `master` branch

### Manual Triggers:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"🚀 Build Timetable Optimizer AI"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose build type:
   - **debug**: Only debug APK
   - **release**: Only release APK
   - **both**: Both APKs (recommended)
